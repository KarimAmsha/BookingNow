# BookingNow
Simple App that implements SwiftUI features

Instructions:
The main interface displays the categories at the top and tabs, and in the main category, the main elements, and by clicking on one of the elements, it goes to the booking details, and by pressing the map icon, the map appears, and by pressing the reservation button, the reservation interface appears by choosing the date and other details related to the booking.
I programmed, developed and handled the calendar from start to end.
I followed the MVVM architecture in data flow and design.
In case of any problem please contact me.
You can run the application via xcode or contact me to upload a version for you to run directly on your phones.
The approximate time it takes to work is about 16 hours
